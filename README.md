## Getting Started 

### Discription

This was my first time using CircutPython but I did have some experince with the Metro Express board. My first expriences with CircutPython was pretty positive. I ran into some problems at the start, but I was able to overcome the issues by asking a classmate in one of are breakout rooms and help from Mr.Helmstetter. I was not able to complete any of the assingments in the first week. It was mostly spent just trying to get use to CircutPython.
